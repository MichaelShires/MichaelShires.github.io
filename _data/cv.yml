  type: nested_list
  contents:
    - title: Reliable and Dependable Computing
      items: 
        - As digital technology advances, critical infrastructure in certain applications (flight, medical, reactor safety) advance at glacial paces due to the expensive but necessary cost of testing.
        - My academic goals are to use my operational knowledge of reactor plants, and organizational structures to drive this technology in a direction that regulatory organizations would approve of.
    - title: Computer Architecture and Optimization
      items:
        - As <a href="http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm"> Herb Sutter</a> said in 2005, "The Free Lunch Is Over" (Sutter, 2005). Transistors get smaller and the direction of computer architecture has to shift.
        - Modern research is focusing more and more on concurrency, optimization, and hardware data transit speeds.
        - Certain programming languages have gained immense popularity due to their ease of writing code, but relative inefficient execution. If we want to continue seeing exponential gains in computing ability, the ability for a programmer to write easy, clean code that is also optimized will be a priority.

  contents:
    - <u>Hobbies:</u> I am an avid fan of "The Lord of The Rings" and anything Tolkien related!
    - When I have time I also love to cook, bake, and consider myself an amateur cinephile - mostly my wife and I just watch movies together.
