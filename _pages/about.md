Hi everyone! My name is Michael, and this is my personal website to share a bit about myself and whatever happens to be on my mind.

Currently, I'm an instructor and active-duty in the U.S. Navy, stationed at [Naval Nuclear Power Training Unit](https://www.navsea.navy.mil/Home/NPTU/Charleston/) (NPTU) Charleston, here in Charleston, South Carolina. I currently work in the Sea-Returnee Off-Crew (SROC) office, where I teach prospective staff instructors the fundamentals of nuclear chemistry control, casualty response, and lead them in small group seminars where we dive deep into the theory behind specific topics.

I was an instructor on crew on the Moored Training Ship (MTS) 711 for about a year before coming to SROC.

Before coming to prototype, I was an Engineering Laboratory Technician (ELT) on the USS [Indiana (SSN 789)](https://www.sublant.usff.navy.mil/SSN789/) for four years. I showed up to the ship while it was still a Pre-Commissioning Unit (PCU) and followed her through commissioning, a change of homeport to Groton CT, and eventually her maiden deployment.

I'm also a remote undergraduate student at [Pennsylvania State University - World Campus](https://www.worldcampus.psu.edu) pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Software Engineering, to be completed in June 2025.

Conveniently, I also finish my active duty naval service in June 2025. Please take a look around and reach out to me if you have any questions, or if you just want to chat about anything - whether it's leadership, the military, computer/software engineering, or the universal love of pets.
