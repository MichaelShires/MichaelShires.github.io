This is a more thorough biography, also just a bit more about me that couldn't(shouldn't?) fit on the 'About' page.

## Navy

I joined the Navy at 18 years old, exactly six days after graduating high school in 2015. I was involved in robotics and computer stuff for almost my entire life up till this point, and my goal was to become an Electronics Technician on a submarine. Why? I'm not really sure. I wanted to do something exciting and stick with computer stuff I think.

I showed up to boot camp and had a blast, and then got hit with a shocker - you don't get to choose your job, and I was selected for Mechanic. This kind of blew me away as I had never done anything mechanical remotely in my life. It would turn out to be one of the best things that happened to me, but looking back on it I'm still a little bittersweet.

### Nuclear Training Pipeline

I finish "A" school where they teach us about different types of wrenches (actually) and I did pretty well, and then I finished Power School where I also performed all right. I was really getting into the idea of being a submarine mechanic, and enjoyed what i was learning.

In prototype I had an absolute blast. I really felt at home there, in a way that I can never really put to words. I had been told about this job that mechanics could specialize in, called an "ELT" - short for Engineering Laboratory Technician. They specialized in chemistry, and radiological controls (RadCon).

I had no interest in this program as I hated chemistry and RadCon throughout the program so far, it had just felt like memorizing. However, I put in for it and was selected - which really was the best thing that ever happened to me. ELTs are subject-matter experts, and masters of their craft.

It's an incredibly tight community, and while you're held to a high standard I don't think any other job in the Nuclear Navy would have given me the same job satisfaction.

### PCU Indiana (SSN 789)

After that, I got orders to the PCU Indiana (SSN 789) being built in Norfolk, VA in the fall of 2017. At the same time my mom was diagnosed with stage IV melanoma, and was hesitantly given a terminal prognosis. I'm from Richmond VA, and my family was all still there at the time, so I put in for anything in VA.

Well I got it, except in a last minute change of events my ship was scheduled to move to CT. Because the submarine ship-building process takes so long, ships will go through a maintenance availability right after being built. They'll finish building, get sent to sea on sea-trials, do a bunch of other fun stuff, and then go right back into the yards for a maintenance availability to fix everything that's broken since they started building it.

We were originally supposed to stay in Virginia for a bit, but plans change and boats move, and we were told in the spring of 2018, less than six months after I showed up, that the ship was moving to Groton CT. From being told to move, and getting on the road and driving to Connecticut, I spent <i>two nights</i> at home. My girlfriend at the time (now wife) planned everything. She packed up the entire apartment and found a place in CT for us to live.

I got home after the <a href="https://ssn789.org/events/commissioning.html">Commissioning Ceremony</a> in Florida and everything was packed, the U-haul was reserved, and movers were coming to help load it up. I think that's where I really started to think I should marry her.

### USS Indiana (SSN 789)

My time in Connecticut went by relatively fast, although I don't think I would have said that at the time. I made friends that I'll have for a lifetime, I had a relatively successful career where I qualified everything available to me. I was promoted to First Class Petty Officer on my first advancement opportunity, and was selected as the Leading ELT for my last year on board.

The ship went on her maiden deployment while I was in CT. I earned my "blue nose" on that deployment, and moored in Spain twice - although due to COVID we weren't actually able to do anything.

After that I started to turn over my responsibilities on board and focus on leaving. The ship got ready for her second deployment, I started school at Penn State - World Campus, and I got orders to South Carolina.
